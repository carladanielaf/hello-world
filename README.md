Trying new skills
Hello system,

Carla here. I'm trying to find sth that makes me want to have a purpose when I get up in the morning and that allows me to work from some place that not my working space. I'm trying to rush things up to see how it goes. It's really interesting to open your eyes for a world so full of possibilities.
